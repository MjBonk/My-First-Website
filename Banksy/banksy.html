        <h2>Who is Banksy?</h2>
        <section>
          <p>
            Very little is known about Banksy himself, as he refuses to be
            interviewed and carefully maintains his anonymity. A
            world-renowned mystery man, Banksy has risen through the ranks to
            become one of the world’s greatest street artists partly by
            cultivating in his collectors an urgency and desire to unveil his
            character. Street art fanatics are consistently impressed by the
            far-reaching scope, variety, and bravery of every artwork he
            delivers, but are always left wanting more. This tactic encourages
            viewers to explore a completely new perspective or idea, often
            inspiring both amateur and professional artists. This inspiration
            is also known as the “Banksy Effect.”

                Twenty years ago, on a whitewashed storefront wall in
                Shoreditch, London, the anonymous street artist Banksy
                stenciled out a spare, innocent image: a young girl, windswept
                and monochrome, reaching for a bright red, heart-shaped
                balloon. At the time, Banksy was still far from a household
                name, he was a nich artist. Two decades on, Shoreditch stencil
                has become one of the most popular images of the 21st century.
                <br />
                <br />Just seconds after a painting of Girl With Balloon sold
                at Sotheby’s in London in 2018, the artwork suddenly began to
                destroy itself through a shredder hidden inside the frame. The
                winning bidder went through with the purchase anyway, and the
                work was renamed Love Is In The Bin – the only original
                artwork ever to be created live at auction. On 14 October 2021
                Love is in the Bin became the most expensive Banksy ever to be
                sold at auction when it achieved a staggering £18,582,000 at
                Sotheby’s.

            At the age of 18, Banksy was nearly caught vandalizing public
            spaces by police. As his crew fled from the scene, Banksy was
            stuck hiding beneath a dustbin van. Banksy noticed stencil letters
            sprayed onto the truck, and, as he had been looking for a faster
            way to paint at the time, he decided stencilling would be his new
            graffiti style. Banksy’s works often take the form of
            multi-layered stencils combined with other media sources. He
            sometimes includes objects that already exist on his chosen
            ‘canvas,’ such as street signs and fire hydrants, to turn his work
            into striking street art installations. His artwork is often
            satirical, combining dark humour with messages about art,
            philosophy, and politics. <br /><br />
            By the early 2000s, Banksy had relocated from Bristol to London,
            where he began to gain notoriety; but, at the same time, his
            international work was taking off. He soon decided to travel to
            Palestine and the West Bank, where he stencilled nine now-iconic
            images onto the newly-erected West Bank Wall, including ‘Love is
            in the Air.’ These images were an instant hit and exploded online.
            At this time, Banksy’s work were racking up record-breaking sales
            in storied art auctions such as Sotheby’s and Bonhams of London.
            These successful sales marked Banksy’s dramatic entry into the
            commercial art world. In 2010, Banksy assumed the role of author
            and filmmaker for his film
