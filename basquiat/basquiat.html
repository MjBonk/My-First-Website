            <h2>Who was JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT?</h2>
            <section>
               <p>
                  Jean-Michel Basquiat was a jack of all trades: musician, graffiti artist and poet. But he is most
                  famous for his paintings.
                  Basquiat was born in Brooklyn, New York, on December 22, 1960.
                  A self-taught artist, Basquiat began drawing at an early age on sheets of paper his father, an
                  accountant, brought home from the office. As he delved deeper into his creative side, his mother
                  strongly encouraged him to pursue his artistic talents.
                  Basquiat first attracted attention for his graffiti in New York City in the late 1970s, under the name
                  "SAMO." Working with a close friend, he tagged subway trains and Manhattan buildings with cryptic
                  aphorisms. SAMO — pronounced same-oh — started off as a private joke and went on to become an
                  important symbol in Basquiat’s later work. It stands for ‘Same Old Shit’.


                  In 1977 Basquiat quit high school a year before he was slated to graduate. To make ends meet, he sold
                  sweatshirts and postcards featuring his artwork on the streets of his native New York.

                     André the Giant Has a Posse by OBEY is a campaign made in 1989, when Fairey was still
                     attending his studies at the Rhode Island School of Design.

                     Fairey says that André the Giant was a spontaneous, happy accident when he was teaching
                     his friend how to make stencils in 1989. They found an ad on a newspaper with André the
                     Giant and Fairey suggested that picture for the stencil but his friend didn’t like it.
                     So, Fairey made the stencil and a few stickers.

                     Fairey says, the text reads as ANDRÉ THE GIANT HAS A POSSE because “the group of guys I
                     was hanging out with always called each other The Posse, so it said André the Giant Has
                     a Posse, and it was sort of appropriated from hip-hop slang – Public Enemy, N.W.A and
                     Ice-T were all using the word - as an in-joke between friends”.

                     According to Fairey, this work was “an experiment in phenomenology”. He made stickers
                     with the portraits of André the Giant and then, Fairey distributed his stickers all
                     around in the skater community and it resulted in these stickers to be all across the
                     cities in the United States.

                  Basquiat's work mixed together many different styles and techniques. His paintings often included
                  words and text, his graffiti was expressive and often abstract, and his logos and iconography had a
                  deep historical resonance.
                  It isn’t just the messages in his paintings that are radical and thought-provoking, but also his
                  technique and novel style which had never been seen before. His art looks like a mosaic of random
                  thoughts. Basquiat cared less
                  about his art being aesthetically pleasing and more about the emotions it sparks and subliminal
                  information that it conveys to the viewer.
                  <br><br>
                  Basquiat’s big break came in June 1980, when his work was included in The Times Square Show, a
                  multi-artist exhibition curated by radical New York collective Colab and Fashion Moda, a South Bronx
                  community arts space. Staged in an abandoned midtown building, the show also included works by Kenny
                  Scharf, Jenny Holzer, Nan Goldin and Keith Haring.
