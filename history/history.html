            <h2>What is streetart?</h2>
            <section>
               <p>
                  Street art is visual art created in public locations for public visibility. It has been associated
                  with the terms "independent art," "post-graffiti", "neo-graffiti" and guerrilla art.[2]

                  Street art has evolved from the early forms of defiant graffiti into a more commercial form of art, as
                  one of the main differences now lies with the messaging. Street art is often meant to provoke thought
                  rather than rejection among the general audience through making its purpose more evident than that of
                  graffiti. The issue of permission has also come at the heart of street art, as graffiti is usually
                  done illegally, whereas street art can nowadays be the product of an agreement or even sometimes a
                  commission. However, it remains different from traditional art exposed in public spaces by its
                  explicit use of said space in the conception phase.

                  <p>
                     The roots of street art can be traced back to the graffiti subculture that emerged in the late
                     1960s and early 1970s in cities like New York and Philadelphia. Graffiti artists, often using
                     pseudonyms
                     or “tags,” would leave their marks on walls, trains, and other public spaces. Initially seen as an
                     act
                     of rebellion and vandalism, graffiti served as a form of self-expression for marginalized
                     communities
                     seeking visibility and recognition.
                     <br><br>
                     Graffiti played a pivotal role in the evolution of street art, laying the foundation for its
                     emergence
                     as a global movement. Artists began to experiment with different styles, techniques, and messages,
                     transcending the traditional confines of graffiti. Stencil art, wheat pasting, and muralism became
                     popular forms of street art, enabling artists to create larger and more intricate works in public
                     spaces.

                  <h3>The Rise of Street Art</h3>
                  By the 1980s, street art started gaining wider recognition, thanks to influential artists like
                  Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. Their works brought street art into galleries and museums,
                  blurring the lines between the underground and the mainstream art world. This shift helped
                  legitimize
                  street art as a legitimate and powerful form of artistic expression.
                  <br><br>
                  <h3>Exploring Styles and Techniques</h3>
                  As street art evolved, artists began exploring various styles and techniques. From realistic
                  portraits
                  to abstract compositions, artists embraced a wide range of artistic approaches. Stencils and
                  stickers
                  allowed for quick and repeatable images, while muralism provided an opportunity for large-scale
                  artworks that transformed entire neighborhoods. Street artists also experimented with mediums such
                  as
                  spray paint, acrylics, and even installations, pushing the boundaries of what street art could be.
                  <br><br>
                  <h3>Street Art and Social Activism</h3>
                  One of the most significant aspects of street art is its ability to convey powerful social and
                  political messages. Artists use their works to raise awareness about pressing issues such as
                  inequality, racism, environmental concerns, and human rights. Street art serves as a voice for
                  marginalized communities, sparking conversations and challenging the status quo. In recent years,
                  movements like Black Lives Matter and climate activism have been amplified through the visual
                  impact
                  of street art, fostering dialogue and inspiring change.
                  <br><br>
                  From its humble origins in graffiti culture, street art has undergone a remarkable transformation,
                  evolving into a global movement that transcends boundaries and captures the imagination of people
                  worldwide. It has challenged the traditional art world, invigorated public spaces, and provided a
                  platform for social and political activism. Street art continues to evolve, adapting to new
                  technologies and societal changes while maintaining its essence as a powerful form of artistic
                  expression. As we move forward, it is crucial to recognize and celebrate the impact of street art,
                  embracing its potential to create dialogue, inspire, and transform our urban environments.

                  You can not talk about the rise of grafitti without mentioning Darryl McCray, better known by his
                  tagging name Cornbread.
                  He is an American graffiti writer from Philadelphia. He is widely considered the world's first modern
                  graffiti artist.
                  McCray was raised in Brewerytown, a neighborhood of North Philadelphia. During the late 1960s, he and
                  a group
                  of friends started doing graffiti in Philadelphia, by writing their monikers on walls across the
                  city. The movement spread to New York City and blossomed into the modern graffiti movement, which
                  <img class="aside__img-float" src="/img/cornbread-world.png" alt="">
                  reached its peak in the U.S. in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and then spread to Europe. McCray
                  later worked with the Philadelphia's Anti-Graffiti Network and Mural Arts Program to help combat the
                  spread of graffiti in the city. He is currently a public speaker and a youth advocate.

               <p>
                  “When I realized all I had to do was write my name on bizarre things, I became a glutton for
                  publicity...and the media was more than glad to accommodate me,” he remembers.
                  He cannily kept upping the ante — tagging the Jackson 5 plane, police cars, and in one of his favorite
                  stories, an elephant.
                  “I was on the bus one day, reading the newspaper and it said ‘Cornbread is shot to death.’ I knew I
                  had to do something amazingly bizarre to let people know I wasn’t dead. I started writing ‘the real
                  Cornbread is not dead,’ but people thought it was an imposter. So I go to the zoo. It’s a big tourist
                  attraction. I watch the zookeeper shower the elephant with a hose, watch him tug on his flappy ears,
                  and pat his side. The elephant is tame. I saw the zookeeper was not in danger.
                  “After three days of watching this, I go to the zoo early in the morning, climb over the fence, into
                  elephant’s enclosure. I take the top off the spray paint, start shaking. The balls start rattling. He
                  turns around, he looks at me, doesn’t pay attention. I paint ‘Cornbread lives’ right on his side.”
                  It seemed to work. At least the police, who arrested him, knew he was alive.
