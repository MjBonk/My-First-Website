            <h2>Who was Keith Haring?</h2>
            <section>
               <p>
                  Keith Haring was an artist and social activist whose colorful pop art embodied the lively spirit of
                  the hip-hop and nightclub scenes in 1980s New York City. Haring first rose to prominence for his
                  stylized chalk drawings in New York City subway stations; his sprawling subway graffiti art garnered
                  attention from the established art world. As his career blossomed, he produced large-scale public
                  murals and displayed his art in museums and galleries all over the world. Much of Haring's work
                  promotes social activism, particularly AIDS awareness and racial equality.

                     Haring used his platform as an artist to raise awareness of AIDS. He himself was diagnosed with the
                     disease in 1988. His poster Ignorance = Fear refers to the challenges people who were living with
                     AIDS faced. He wanted to reach as many people as possible and highlight the importance of AIDS
                     education.

                     Haring set up The Keith Haring Foundation, a year after his diagnosis, to provide funding and
                     support to AIDS research, charities and education.

                     Keith Haring died of AIDS related complications on 16 February 1990 aged 31. The Keith Haring
                     Foundation continues to strive to meet Keith Haring’s wishes. If you’d like to help support the
                     fight against AIDS, visit the Elizabeth Glaser AIDS Foundation (a partner of The Keith Haring
                     Foundation) to see what you can do.

                  Shepard Fairey is renowned for iconic artworks featuring Andre the Giant, the Obey trademark,
                  and a notable Barack
                  Obama propaganda poster. In 2008, Fairey's Obama image graced Time Magazine's Person of the Year
                  cover, and he
                  was commissioned again in 2011. His portrait of Barack Obama catapulted him to national
                  prominence, earning him the
                  Brit Insurance Design of the Year Award in 2009. Fairey has held successful exhibitions
                  worldwide, including the 2019
                  show "Facing the Giant: Three Decades of Dissent," exploring themes of empowerment, rebellion,
                  social issues, and political commentary in his work.
                  Fairey is known for his activism and humanitarian efforts. Fairey's art blends graffiti,
                  pop art, business art, and Marxist theory, exhibited in galleries and museums globally.
