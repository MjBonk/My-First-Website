            <h2>Who was Keith Haring?</h2>
            <section>
               <p>
                  After graduating from high school in 1976, Haring briefly
                  attended the Ivy School of Professional Art in Pittsburgh, dropping out after two semesters. In 1978,
                  he decided to return to school, moving to New York City to enroll at the School of Visual Arts.
                  He began using the city as his canvas, making chalk
                  drawings in subway stations. His art was eventually seen everywhere from public murals and nightclubs
                  to galleries and museums around the world. He was also known for his activism in promoting AIDS
                  awareness. He died of AIDS-related complications on February 16, 1990, at age 31.

               <h2>THE KEITH HARING FOUNDATION</h2>
               <div>

                  <p>
                     Haring used his platform as an artist to raise awareness of AIDS. He himself was diagnosed with the
                     disease in 1988. His poster Ignorance = Fear refers to the challenges people who were living with
                     AIDS faced. He wanted to reach as many people as possible and highlight the importance of AIDS
                     education.

                     Haring set up The Keith Haring Foundation, a year after his diagnosis, to provide funding and
                     support to AIDS research, charities and education.

                     Keith Haring died of AIDS related complications on 16 February 1990 aged 31. The Keith Haring
                     Foundation continues to strive to meet Keith Haring’s wishes. If you’d like to help support the
                     fight against AIDS, visit the Elizabeth Glaser AIDS Foundation (a partner of The Keith Haring
                     Foundation) to see what you can do.

                  Much of Haring's work promotes social activism, particularly AIDS awareness and racial
                  equality. Haring soon began to apply his universally recognizable imagery to freestanding drawings and
                  paintings. Living and working in the East Village in New York, Keith Haring had a large social circle,
                  which included many artists and performers who were part of the same underground art scene. This
                  included people such as Madonna, <a href="/basquiat/basquiat.html">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a> and Andy
                  Warhol, that he frequently worked with.
                  The energy and optimism of his art, with its bold lines and bright colors, brought him
                  popularity with a wide audience. Throughout the 1980s, Haring's work was exhibited widely
                  both within the United States and internationally.
                  Over the brief span of his career, the artist completed more
                  than 50 public works, including the anti-drug mural Crack is Wack in a Harlem playground and an
                  illuminated, animated billboard of his "radiant baby" image for New York's Times Square. He also
                  hosted numerous art workshops for children.
