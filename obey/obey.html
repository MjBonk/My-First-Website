            <h2>Who is Shepard Fairey?</h2>
            <section>
               <p>
                  Frank “Shepard Fairey” is a very famous graphic artist, muralist, and overall artist. He was
                  born on February 15,
                  1970 in Charleston, in the United States. In 1988, the artist graduated from Idyllwild Arts
                  Academy and he earned
                  his Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence in 1992. He was
                  deeply involved
                  in the skateboarding community, leading him to incorporate his drawings into T-shirts,
                  skateboards and stickers.
                  Pasting his stickers over the skatepars, ignited his passion for street art and graffiti
                  culture. He has navigated between
                  fine art, commercial art, street art, and political art throughout his career, establishing
                  himself as one of the most
                  influential figures in the field.

               <h2>André the Giant Has a Posse</h2>
               <div>
                  <img class="float-img" src="/obey/obey-img/posse.jpeg" width="40%" alt="">
                  <p>
                     André the Giant Has a Posse by OBEY is a campaign made in 1989, when Fairey was still
                     attending his studies at the Rhode Island School of Design.

                     Fairey says that André the Giant was a spontaneous, happy accident when he was teaching
                     his friend how to make stencils in 1989. They found an ad on a newspaper with André the
                     Giant and Fairey suggested that picture for the stencil but his friend didn’t like it.
                     So, Fairey made the stencil and a few stickers.

                     Fairey says, the text reads as ANDRÉ THE GIANT HAS A POSSE because “the group of guys I
                     was hanging out with always called each other The Posse, so it said André the Giant Has
                     a Posse, and it was sort of appropriated from hip-hop slang – Public Enemy, N.W.A and
                     Ice-T were all using the word - as an in-joke between friends”.

                     According to Fairey, this work was “an experiment in phenomenology”. He made stickers
                     with the portraits of André the Giant and then, Fairey distributed his stickers all
                     around in the skater community and it resulted in these stickers to be all across the
                     cities in the United States.

                  Shepard Fairey is renowned for iconic artworks featuring Andre the Giant, the Obey trademark,
                  and a notable Barack
                  Obama propaganda poster. In 2008, Fairey's Obama image graced Time Magazine's Person of the Year
                  cover, and he
                  was commissioned again in 2011. His portrait of Barack Obama catapulted him to national
                  prominence, earning him the
                  Brit Insurance Design of the Year Award in 2009. Fairey has held successful exhibitions
                  worldwide, including the 2019
                  show "Facing the Giant: Three Decades of Dissent," exploring themes of empowerment, rebellion,
                  social issues, and political commentary in his work.
                  Fairey is known for his activism and humanitarian efforts. Fairey's art blends graffiti,
                  pop art, business art, and Marxist theory, exhibited in galleries and museums globally.
